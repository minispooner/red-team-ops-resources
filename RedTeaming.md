# Benefits of Red Teaming
- Measures actual defenses. Invalidates assumptions and unveils the truth.
- Exercises an org's defensive muscles to help them improve their detective and responsive capabilities.
- "Rather than simply seeking to keep security incidents from occurring, it is critical to assume that a security incident can and will occur. The information gained from Red Teaming and live site penetration testing exercises helps to significantly strengthen defenses, improve response strategies, train defenders, and drive greater effectiveness of the entire security program."
